You can find here class names files for the different supported datasets.

## Pascal VOC

Text file listing *Pascal VOC* class names in the correct order: [voc.names](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/voc.names).

## COCO

Text file listing *COCO* class names in the correct order: [coco.names](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/blob/master/data/coco.names).

## Imagenet

There aren't much pre-trained models available on Imagenet for Object Detection, so we've trained our own model specificaly for person class.  
So just create a file with one entry person or just use [this file](https://gist.github.com/aaronpolhamus/964a4411c0906315deb9f4a3723aac57).

Faster R-CNN model for the same class names file [here](http://wiki.jderobot.org/store/deeplearning-networks/TensorFlow/faster-rcnn_Imagenet(ILSVRC2014)_person_only.pb) .
