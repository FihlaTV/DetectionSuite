Here, you can find models for the different supported frameworks.


## TensorFlow Models
TensorFlow models can be downloaded from [TensorFlow model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md), or from our own set of models available [here](http://wiki.jderobot.org/store/deeplearning-networks/TensorFlow/).

## Keras Models
We have made our own set of Keras Models, compatible with the latest version, requiring on the HDF5 file to load the model completely.
Here's the [link](http://wiki.jderobot.org/store/deeplearning-networks/Keras/).

## Caffe Models
Caffe Models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn#model-zoo) and the config files are available [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/master/testdata/dnn). We will soon index them at our own server, for easier access.
